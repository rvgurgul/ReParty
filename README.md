# ReParty
Welcome to ReParty, a program for scanning SpyParty replays and viewing head-to-head results.

Please direct problems, questions, and feedback to Legorve Genine 3815 on Discord.

# Installation
To install, simply click on the 'dist' folder, save the RePartyApplication.exe to your machine, and run it.  (I have no idea if/how ReParty will run on Operating Systems other than Windows, so use at your own risk.)

A configuration file will be created in the directory you put the executable.

# Problems?
If ReParty closes unexpectedly, your config will be updated with an error report. Please forward this to Legorve to aid in fixing the bug :)

# v1.0 Features
Query your SpyParty replay folders by players, role, venue, missions completed, mission win countdown, and game result.

View the head-to-head results of each player, on each role, on each venue.

# Planned Features
(working, but not implemented) Create a replay sniper set from query results.

Search for mission setups (any/known/pick X/Y) for each venue.

Improve performance.
